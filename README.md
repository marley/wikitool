# Logo Requested Wikipedia Pages

**What:** [This page](https://marley.github.io/wikitool/) lists wikipedia pages currently tagged as needing logos, displaying thumbnails of all images on that page.

**Why:** Some of these pages have been updated to include a logo but are still tagged as needing logos. This tool will allow a wikipedia user to quickly see which pages still need logos and which can be marked as resolved.

# To Run

1.  Open `index.html`
